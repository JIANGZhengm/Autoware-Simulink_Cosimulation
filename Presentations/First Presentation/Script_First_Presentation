Because Autoware is ROS based software. Self driving modules are developed using ROS. 
In ROS, the software is abstracted as nodes and topics. 
Node represent individual component modules, 
Topics mediate inputs and outputs between nodes. 
Communication between nodes follows a publish/ subscribe model.
However, it is also possible to use MATLAB/Simulink to develop ROS nodes for co-simulation.
To do this, one approach is to use Robotic System Toolbox

Page 9 [Phuris]
In the Robotic System Toolbox, there are 3 main modules. 
The first one is MATLAB-ROS interface. 
This module enable us to write robot algorithm in MATLAB and use ROS to test the algorithm in real robot or in simulator. 
Also, data from ROS robots can be imported to visualise and analyze in MATLAB.
The second module is Built-in Robotic Algorithm. 
This provide standard robotic algorithms such as Path planning, Path tracking as a building block to develop a specific robot.
The third module is Simulink-ROS interface. This module allow us to design our algorithm in Simulink. 
The algorithm can be tested the same way as in MATLAB-ROS interface module.
ROS node can be generated from the algorithm that is developed by Simulink.

We also found Autoware Toolbox which is a set of sample algorithms suite for Autoware. 
For example, there are ACF Detector node which Detecting people using aggregate channel features. 
These code are available in both Matlab and Simulink file. 
With these codes we are going to connect Autoware to MATLAB/Simulink via Robotic System Toolbox.
